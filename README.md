# Intro Computer Programming

This project was made on `November 8, 2018` during my time as a Sophomore in highschool. It's not perfect, and I have created much better things since then. However, this was the beginning of my love for coding and what sparked my passion.

To anyone who comes across this; I would like it to be known that my Computer Science teacher at the time helped spark this love and passion for coding that I have now. Not only has he inspired me to pursue Computer Science, but continue my passion in College.

So once again, thank you.
